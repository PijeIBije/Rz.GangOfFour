from stack overflow on difference between C# events and observer pattern:

Only hook events you need
With events, you only need to implement handlers for events you're interested in handling. 
In the observer public interface pattern, you'd have to implement all methods in the entire public interface 
including implementing method bodies for notification types you don't actually care about handling. 
In your example, you always have to implement OnFoundDirectory and OnFoundFile, even if you only care about one of these events.
